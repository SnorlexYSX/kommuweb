            <h1 class="h2 text-white">Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="h5 text-gray-light">This privacy policy (“Private Policy”) explains our policies and practices regarding how data may be collected, stored, used, transferred, shared or sold by Kommu. This Privacy Policy applies to KommuAssist, which is a hardware and software developed by Kommu.</p>
            <br><p class="h5 text-gray-light">Before using and by accessing KommuAssist, you indicate that you have read, understood our Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy, and that you agree to our collection, storage, use, disclosure, and sale of your personal information as described in our Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.</p>
            <br><p class="h5 text-gray-light">Kommu may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time without notice. If you object to any changes to the Privacy Policy, you may stop using KommuAssist. Your continued use of KommuAssist will constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions to the Privacy Policy.</p>
            
            <h2 class="h4 text-white font-bold">A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type of Information We Collect</h2>
            <p class="h5 text-gray-light">By using KommuAssist, you agree that Kommu owns all data that is conveyed to us by use of the service and that we may use it any way, and alter it in any way, at our sole discretion. We may collect your personal information, such as your name, phone number, and email address, as well as other information you provide to us. Personally-identifiable information or any information or combination of information that both relates to you and can be used to identify you (“Personal Information”) may be collected when you consent to that collection by providing such information on a voluntary basis. KommuAssist connects to a motor vehicle’s Controller Area Network (CAN bus), and it receives and generates data about the motor vehicle’s use, operation, and performance, including but not limited to geolocation of the motor vehicle, trip durations and routes, parking locations of your motor vehicle, braking, and acceleration.</p>
            <br><p class="h5 text-gray-light">KommuAssist uses driver monitoring software that watches the driver and tracks his or her head and eyes, ensuring he or she is monitoring the driving environment. We may collect video from the driver monitoring feed only if you opt in through the settings of KommuAssist. You should notify those who use or occupy your motor vehicle while KommuAssist is engaged.</p>
            
            <h2 class="h4 text-white font-bold">B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How We Use the Information We Collect</h2>
            <p class="h5 text-gray-light">Kommu use data collected through KommuAssist to complete transactions with you; to provide, analyse, and improve the performance and security of KommuAssist; to improve or modify other existing products and services; and/or to develop new products and services. We may share personal information with service providers and business partners, or with other third parties.</p>
            <br><p class="h5 text-gray-light">Kommu may also share information collected through KommuAssist to comply with a legal obligation, when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, in response to a lawful request by government authorities, or in other circumstances in which sharing such information may be required by law. Unless you have opted out of receiving materials or notifications from us, we may periodically use your email address to send you such materials and notifications. If you want to stop receiving such materials and notifications from us, you can contact us at the information below to alert us to your preference. In addition, you can opt out of, or unsubscribe from, receipt of such emails at any time by following the instructions contained in those emails.</p>
            
            <h2 class="h4 text-white font-bold">C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How You Can Access Your Information</h2>
            <p class="h5 text-gray-light">You have options regarding certain information provided for use with KommuAssist, as described in this policy. You may decline to share the driver monitoring camera recording with us. Your privacy profile settings are accessible via the settings button in KommuAssist. You can review and update your personal information by contacting us at the email address provided below.</p>
            
            <h2 class="h4 text-white font-bold">D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p class="h5 text-gray-light mb-12">We will constantly update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices. If we make any material change in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will notify you by sending an email to the email address you most recently provided us, unless we do not have such an email address, and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our social media. We recommend that you check our social media from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy.</p>
