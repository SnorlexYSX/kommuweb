      <h1 class="h2 text-white">KommuAssist Trade‑in Policy</h1>
      <p class="h5">This Trade‑in Policy governs the return of eligible KommuAssist KA1/KA1s devices in exchange for a trade‑in discount on the purchase of a new KommuAssist 2 (“KA2”). By participating, you agree to the terms below.</p>

      <h2 class="h4 text-white font-bold">1.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspReturn‑First Requirement</h2>
      <p class="h5">Your KA1/KA1s must be returned to—and received by—Kommu <span class="text-white">seven (7) days before</span> we ship your new KA2. No KA2 units will be dispatched until the trade‑in device has been received.</p>

      <h2 class="h4 text-white font-bold">2.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspInstallation at Kommu HQ</h2>
      <p class="h5">If you choose installation at Kommu HQ, after checking out KA2 you must <span class="text-white">post your trade‑in device</span> to us using the instructions provided in your e‑receipt. Please ensure it is sent and received prior to your installation appointment.</p>

      <h2 class="h4 text-white font-bold">3.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNo Walk‑in Returns on Installation Day</h2>
      <p class="h5">We cannot accept trade‑in devices brought on the day of installation. We require time to inspect device condition; failure to return the device in advance will <span class="text-white">forfeit the trade‑in discount</span> and standard pricing will apply.</p>

      <h2 class="h4 text-white font-bold">4.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspScope of Trade‑in</h2>
      <p class="h5">Trade‑in covers the <span class="text-white">device unit and new mount only</span>. Keep and reuse your existing wiring, connectors, and accessories.</p>

      <h2 class="h4 text-white font-bold">5.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCondition Check</h2>
      <p class="h5">Receipt of a device does not automatically guarantee the discount. The trade‑in discount is confirmed only after Kommu completes inspection of the returned device for eligibility under this policy.</p>

      <h2 class="h4 text-white font-bold">6.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGeneral</h2>
      <ul class="h5">
        <li>a) Participation in the trade‑in program constitutes acceptance of this policy.</li>
        <li>b) Kommu may amend or terminate the program at any time without prior notice.</li>
      </ul>
